# PythonQt

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mevislab/pythonqt.svg?color=blue)](LICENSE)

PythonQt is a dynamic [Python](https://www.python.org) binding for [Qt](https://www.qt.io).
It offers an easy way to embed the Python scripting language into
your Qt applications.

# Documentation

API documentation is available at: https://mevislab.github.io/pythonqt

# Licensing

PythonQt is distributed under the `LGPL 2.1` license.

## Licensing of Generator

The build system of PythonQt makes use of a patched version of the LGPL'ed QtScript
generator, located in the `generator` directory.

See the `LICENSE.LGPL` file in the generator subdirectory for details.
Copyright (C) 2009 Nokia Corporation and/or its subsidiary(-ies)

See https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-labs/qtscriptgenerator.git for the original project.
The PythonQt wrappers generated by the generator are distributed under the `LGPL`
as well.

The generated wrappers are pre-generated and checked-in, so you only
need to build and run the generator when you want to build additional wrappers
or you want to upgrade/downgrade to another Qt version, but this requires
updating the typesystems as well.

# Building

## General

Building PythonQt requires a couple of steps.
Follow these instructions in order to get a correctly built PythonQt runtime and Qt bindings.

### Recommendations

It is recommended to build the Qt bindings yourself instead of using the pregenerated ones.
This ensures the bindings are compatible with your Qt version.
Do not build `PythonQt.pro` directly because it will only use the pregenerated bindings!

### Environment

First, you need to set a couple of environment variables, which depend on your Python and Qt installation.

- `PYTHON_VERSION`

  Set the version of your Python interpreter. The syntax is `<major>.<minor>`, e.g., `3.10`.

- `PYTHON_PATH`

  This is the absolute path to the root directory of your Python installation.

- `PYTHON_LIB`

  The absolute path to the `libs` directory in your python installation `$PYTHON_PATH/libs`.

- `PYTHON_DIR`

  The `PYTHON_DIR` is required for non-Windows installations to find the `python-config` executable.
  This should have the same value as `PYTHON_PATH`.

- `QTDIR`

  The absolute path to the root directory of your Qt installation.

### Binding Generator

1. cd into the `generator` directory
2. Run qmake on `generator.pro`

   `qmake CONFIG+=Release generator.pro`

3. Make the generator

   Use `nmake` for MSVC (Visual Studio; make sure to have the environment variables set for Visual Studio beforehand). Otherwise, use `make`.

4. Generate the bindings

   We use the generator executable from step 3 to generate the bindings.
   The location of the generator executable can vary depending on your platform (the subdirectory is named after the current configuration, e.g., `release`).
   On Windows, the generator is named `pythonqt_generator.exe`; on all other platforms, it is named `pythonqt_generator`.

   `<generator-executable> qtscript_masterinclude.h build_all.txt`

### PythonQt Runtime

Next, we need the PythonQt runtime.

1. cd into the `src` directory
2. qmake `src.pro`

   `qmake CONFIG+=Release src.pro`

3. Make the runtime

   Use `nmake` for MSVC (Visual Studio; make sure to have the environment variables set for Visual Studio beforehand). Otherwise, use `make`.

### Extensions

As a last step, we need to build the extensions.

1. cd into `extensions`
2. qmake `src.pro`

   `qmake CONFIG+=Release extensions.pro`

3. Make the extensions

   Use `nmake` for MSVC (Visual Studio; make sure to have the environment variables set for Visual Studio beforehand). Otherwise, use `make`.

After all these steps, you should now have a fully working PythonQt runtime and Qt bindings for your Python/Qt installation ðŸŽ‰.

## MinGW

It is possible to build PythonQt with MinGW on Windows instead of using MSVC.
